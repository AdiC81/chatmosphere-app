#Chatmosphere

We enable dynamic conversation processes in the digital space.

##What it is?

Chatmosphere is an open source project that aims at improving video call experiences. 

##Why is it useful?

Haven't you had this problem, when you and your friends met in a video call and just couldn't figure out who would talk next? Haven't you been bothered when everybody talks at once and you couldn't understand a thing? Or when you wanted to tell your best buddy something and had to wait for the conversation to end  or use whatsapp in order to tell her?! We're trying to help you with a focus not just on functionality (code), but also on a pleasing user experience. And hey, it will be open source…

##Why are we doing this?

The idea came up during the first SARS-CoV-2 shutdown, when some of us as members of the coop Trink—Genosse started a [virtual bar](https://trink-genosse.de/virtuelle-bar/). We found informal group conversations restricting and hierarchical, as the majority of tools is created to (corporate) meeting culture. We missed the dynamics of a self-organizing crowd hanging out at one big table together. The big table in a bar, on which so many discussions, jokes, comforting talks, utopias and ideas happened.

It's our goal to find interaction patterns that enable informal, unmoderated video calls. It's our hypothesis, that we can prototype these interactions bases on spatialized sound.

##Technologies

We're building in the jitsi API and want to develop a plugin, that allows everyone to use our tool.

##Project status & Where do we want to go with this?

We're currently funded by the Prototype Fund of the BMBF in order to develop a first prototype of our idea, but we'd love to carry on working on this. That's why we are already looking into acquiring additional funding. So if you know something or someone we don't, drop us a line. We'd highly appreciate it.
