![Chatmosphere Demo](docs/chatmosphere.gif)

Chatmosphere is an **open source project that aims to make video calls informal and natural**. We missed the dynamics of a self-organizing crowd hanging out at one big table together. The big table in a bar, on which so many discussions, jokes, comforting talks, utopias and ideas happened. So with chatmosphere you can move and zoom yourself in the area and hear people that are located near by you louder. Learn more [about the Chatmosphere project and ideas here](docs/ABOUT.md)
